        So I'm a 21 year old guy pursuing his Btech from MNIT Jaipur in Electrical Engineering. I'm a third year student
        living my life as a half time day scholar half time hostler. Just like anybody I had dreams and ambitions to achieve the maximum out of my clg life. Be the best in studies , in coding , become the rockstar of clg but as the time passed all these dreams just remained dreams in a closet that never opened up. But recently i've decided to play a restart button and give a fresh start to all my ambitions. All i know is im the guy who from never studying previously got 10GPA in his 10 standard. Looking at this vedio by a vietnamese guy i realize if u plan to achieve onto something then the only one stopping you from achieving is you..

        So I'm starting a life with a routine and hustle. From waking up to time to sleeping on time for the next 6 months
        which are going to be crucial in my coding journey.
